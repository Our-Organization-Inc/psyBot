A mini nodejs program for psychologically
imbalanced patients. An online psychiatrist. The purpose of this program is to help people see world the right way, and tell them that the world isn't bad if seen that way, all diseases can be cured--- or brought at ease at least; and that all problems can be solved unless you are weak enough to be unable to fight them
